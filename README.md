# cli_gem_scraper_recipes_2
Flatiron School project #1: A Ruby gem that provides a CLI to an external data source. The CLI is composed of an Object Oriented Ruby application.

This is a CLI gem that scrapes the bonapetit magazine's website. The site has various recipes that the program will scrape for data
such as: recipe names, descriptions, urls, ingredients and directions.

A user will be able to view a list of recipes, select a recipe and get its ingredients and directions to prepare the dish.
A recipe url is also available to take you to the recipe page and view other content like videos that walk you through the recipe.
